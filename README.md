### Welcome to my Notebook. 




**In my notebook you can find my notes on courses I am taking.**




I love learning computer languages, but sometimes it is hard to keep track of what I did. And sometimes I just can't come up with something I learned earlier. This notebook helps me to keep track of what I do and helps me to find information on problems I have to deal with. 

I also added some of my graphic design projects.
