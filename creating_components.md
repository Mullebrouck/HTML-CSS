# Creating Components


**components.JS**
```js
class StoryBox extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div> Story Box </div>
      );
  }
}
```
``StoryBox`` --> components are written in upper Camel Case
``React.Components`` --> Inherits from the React Base class
``render ()`` --> Every component will need a ``render()`` function
``<div>`` --> html elements will always be in lowercase + No quotes are needed. ****
