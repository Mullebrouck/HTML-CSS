### Check your CSS code

### Configure Temporary Background Color

- assign temporarily background (yellow or red) to see where boxes are ending up. 

### Configure Temporary Borders

- assign temporarily border, just like with the background, on an element. 


### Use Comments To Find Unexpected Cascade

- comment out some styles, to test. Test with a smaller group. 
- Add styles back in one by one to see where breakdown occurs.
