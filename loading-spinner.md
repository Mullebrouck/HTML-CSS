# Loading-spinner

In this tutorial we are going to learn how to create a "loading-spinner" in HTML and CSS. 

Before we begin make sure you have a HTML document with a link to your CSS stylesheet. (Example: index.html & spinner.css)


We will start by adding a `<div>` element in your HTML `<body>` element. We will add a `class` called 


**Index.html**
```html
<!DOCKTYPE html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Loading-Spinner</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="spinner.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <div>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>

```
