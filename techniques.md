##Fixed Layout (Iced)

= web page content has a fixed width. (It will stick to the left margin)

- To avoid **unbalanced look** you need to configure the page and center it. 


##Fluid Layout (Liquid)

- often takes up 100% of browser viewport
- makes sure to set max. width so text that will be viewed in 100% browser stays readable.
